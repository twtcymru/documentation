# Spam and Inauthentic Activity
You may not use Tŵt services in a manner intended to artificially amplify or suppress information or engage in behavior that manipulates or disrupts another member’s experience. 

This includes commercial spam, and spam that typically aims to drive traffic or attention from a conversation on Tŵt to specific or third-party accounts, Web sites, products, services, or initiatives. 

Inauthentic engagement that attempts to make accounts or content appear more popular or active than they are; coordinated activity through the use of multiple accounts, fake accounts, automation and/or scripting may all result in Limited or Suspended access.

Flooding a timeline - repeatedly posting in rapid succession with little to no engagement - is not allowed.

Unsolicited direct messages or mentioned posts, accounts that follow large numbers of similar accounts, or unsolicited romantic interest is not allowed.

Registration of trademarks or famous names is subject to review, and may be subject to verification. If you are or represent a notable organisation or person and wish to reclaim an account or mark please see https://github.com/tootwales/documentation/blob/main/VerifiedAccounts.md
