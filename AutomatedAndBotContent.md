# Automated and Bot Content

Bots can provide helpful updates and content. However, many members wish to interact with other members, not bots. 

Bot accounts must be marked as such in their account settings (https://toot.wales/settings/profile). This allows members to understand the account is not monitored for replies, and the bot content will not be listed in the Trending section.

## The following bot activity is prohibited and will be suspended from the service:
 - Wholesale redistributing or mirroring content from external services with no discernable consent
 - Mirroring or copying content from people who have not given consent
 - Automatedly posting about trending hashtags or topics
 - Posting the same content across multiple accounts

## The following bot activity is prohibited and accounts will be limited to followers-only:
 - Cross posting non-original content e.g. retweets from Twitter
 - Unmonitored cross poster bots and services
