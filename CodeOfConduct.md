# Tŵt Community Code of Conduct

```
"We'll keep a welcome in the hillside, we'll keep a welcome in the vale"
```

Tŵt Cymru | Toot Wales (“Tŵt”) is a collection of Web services whose mission is to connect Cymru / Wales and its diverse community, at home and abroad, encouraging and enabling the use of the Welsh language online. We strive to provide a welcoming platform that is free from hate, discrimination, and abuse.

Tŵt offers members the opportunity to post text, image, sound and video to the Fediverse, a collection of thousands of servers around the world from which millions of members find and follow people to communicate with. As part of the Fediverse, Tŵt endeavours to provide a moderate, friendly channel for all manner of topics and conversations, while observing the accepted etiquette of being in a public space connected to the federated servers and people around the world.

To that end, the following guidance reflects the wishes of the Tŵt membership, its staff, and the community as a whole. While no such document can be inclusive of all eventualities, it offers a guide to the kinds of content and conduct expected on the service. 

Members who contravene this Code of Conduct may be subject to content deletion, account limiting, or account suspension.

**In all cases, when using the Tŵt services be respectful, be mindful, and be nice.**

## Disallowed Content

### The following types of content are disallowed and may be removed:
* Spam, excessive advertising, or accounts used solely for commercial purposes with no community engagement
* Unused accounts (accounts not logged in for 366 days)
* Uncurated bots
* Untagged nudity, including artistic depictions
* Untagged gore or graphic violence, including artistic depictions
* Inauthentic activity

### The following types of content are disallowed and will be removed, and may result in revocation of access to the service:
* Discrimination against race and/or ethnicity, gender, gender identity or expression, sex, sexual orientation, native language, age, ability, marital status, family status, caste, national origin, socioeconomic status, religion, geographic location, or any other dimension of diversity
* Xenophobia and/or violent nationalism
* Hateful terms, symbols, imagery, and shorthand
* Pornographic material, to include any explicit description or display of sexual activity
* Sex work, sexual services, including solicitation and offers for such service
* False or misleading information that may cause or lead to harm

### The following types of content are disallowed and will be removed, and will result in revocation of access to the service:

* Sexual depictions of children, fictional or real
* Content illegal in the United Kingdom, the European Union and its member states, or the United States of America
* Content or conduct promoting the ideology of National Socialism
* Content that can increase the risk that its audience will condone or commit violence against members of another group
* Any conduct intended to stalk or harass other users, or to impede other users from using the service, or to degrade the performance of the service, or to harass other users, or to incite other users to perform any of the aforementioned actions is also disallowed. This includes, but is not limited to:
    * Continuing to engage in conversation with a user that has specifically requested for said engagement to cease and desist is considered harassment, regardless of privacy tools employed.
    * Aggregating, posting, and/or disseminating a person's demographic, personal, or private data without express permission (informally called "doxing" or "dropping dox").
    * Inciting users to engage another user in continued interaction or discussion after a user has requested for said engagement to cease and desist (informally known as "brigading" or "dogpiling").

These provisions notwithstanding, the administrative staff of the service reserves the right to revoke any user's access, at any time, for any reason, except as limited by law.

## Spam and Inauthentic Activity
You may not use Tŵt services in a manner intended to artificially amplify or suppress information or engage in behavior that manipulates or disrupts another member’s experience. This includes commercial spam, and spam that typically aims to drive traffic or attention from a conversation on Tŵt to specific or third-party accounts, Web sites, products, services, or initiatives. Inauthentic engagement that attempts to make accounts or content appear more popular or active than they are; coordinated activity through the use of multiple accounts, fake accounts, automation and/or scripting may all result in Limited or Suspended access.

Flooding a timeline - repeatedly posting in rapid succession with little to no engagement - is not allowed.

Unsolicited direct messages or mentioned posts, accounts that follow large numbers of similar accounts, or unsolicited romantic interest is not allowed.

Registration of trademarks or famous names is subject to review, and may be subject to verification. If you are or represent a notable organisation or person and wish to reclaim an account or mark please see https://github.com/tootwales/documentation/blob/main/VerifiedAccounts.md

## Sensitive Content

We believe that participation in social media should be a rewarding activity, one that brings joy and connection. As such, while there are topics and content that are worthy of discussion, we hope our members are mindful of those who do not want their social media feed to be divisive, inflammatory, or upsetting.

The service provides a headline feature that can be used to title a post. This functionality is known as a “Content Notice” or “Content Warning” or “Content Wrapper” or “CW”. This places the content of a post behind a headline, and requires an affirmative click from members to view its contents. It is similar to describing a section of a Web site or a topic of a discussion board, but each member can create whichever topics they choose. It is not a signal that the content is undesirable, merely that there is a good chance a reasonable portion of the membership does not want to see the full content.

If your post meets one of the following criteria, we ask you to show love and respect for your community and use a CW to describe what the member will see if they choose to open it. 

In all cases the following is guidance, not a rule. We will not limit your account but may retroactively mark your content as sensitive.

Notwithstanding, content that is marked as Disallowed in this policy will be removed regardless of the use of CW functionality.

_(NB: Mastodon does not track hashtags within the CW Headline. Place hashtags in the content of the post.)_

| Topic | Common CW Headlines |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Politics | ukpol, walpol, tory, uspol, trump |
| Nudity | lewd, nude, nudity |
| Mental Health and Health Issues | mh, ph, alc, drugs, addiction, suicide |
| Common Phobias | spiders, heights, snakes, blood |
| Disturbing Content | gore, death, violence, war |
| Offensive Language | swears, nsfw |
| Direct Eye Contact | ec, eye contact |
| Live Sports, Spoilers, and Event Outcomes | WALvIRE, cricket, strictly, bake off |

### Politics
Civil discourse is welcome, but politics and politicking are a divisive issue for many. Politicking (activities performed to acquire or retain the power of politics), aqggressively seeking someone’s vote or agreement, derogatory content about elected politicians, elections and electioneering, or party political messaging should include a CW. Please note, lived experience does not fall under this guidance. 

### Nudity
Tŵt is for use by adults only, however, nudity should be marked with a CW. If staff suspects concerns with non-consensual sharing of nudity, images may be marked sensitive or be removed.

### Mental Health and Health Issues
Many people around the world suffer from all manner of health and mental health issues and may suffer harm being exposed to sensitive content. Show empathy to others by placing your individual health and mental health content behind a CW.

### Common Phobias
Just because you are not afraid of spiders does not mean no-one else is. Anything that is known to be a common phobia deserves a CW, especially if imagery is included.

### Disturbing Content
If there is a valid reason to share content that could reasonably be expected to disturb some, use a CW. Content that glorifies violence will be removed.

### Offensive Language
There are plenty of good reasons and thoughtful or entertaining ways to use offensive or profane language. When using obscene profanity a CW is appropriate. Not everyone shares the same perception of what words are offensive. Any discriminatory, harrassing, disrespectful, or insulting language will be removed regardless of it’s perceived offensiveness or use of CW.

### Direct Eye Contact
This can be a disconcertingly personal invasion of a very impersonal, asymmetrical activity. Additionally, roughly one percent of the population, and therefore one percent of our membership, has an autism spectrum condition, and can find direct eye contact extremely uncomfortable. Please place eye contact imagery behind a CW.

### Live Sports and Events
Putting a CW allows the thread or post to live in the public timeline without spoiling the outcome for others, and without forcing everyone to follow a conversation they have no interest in.

### General CW / Headline Guidance
Some Web sites have named sections. Think of your headline as describing the section for the site that this post belongs in. In no way is CW intended to discourage posting of a particular topic, it is merely a helpful way for the millions of viewers to decide what content they wish to engage with.

Not including CW text will not be grounds for suspension, but please note that many of your community members will not boost or share sensitive content that is not described, limiting your content’s reach on the network. Content and accounts that do not meet our Community Code of Conduct will not be boosted, shared, or recommended by staff.

## Automated and Bot Content
Bots can provide helpful updates and content. However, many members wish to interact with other members, not bots. Bot accounts must be marked as such in their account settings. This allows members to understand the account is not monitored for replies, and the bot content will not be listed in the Trending section.

The following bot activity is prohibited and will be suspended from the service:
* Wholesale redistributing or mirroring content from external services with no discernable consent
* Mirroring or copying content from people who have not given consent
* Automatedly posting about trending hashtags or topics
* Posting the same content across multiple accounts

The following bot activity is prohibited and accounts will be limited to followers-only:
* Cross posting non-original content e.g. retweets from Twitter
* Unmonitored cross poster bots and services

## Journalism
Tŵt is not intended to be a source of global news. Instead, it can serve as a place to discuss the news. We exist for community, not content consumption. 

Journalism is a vital profession and activity, and we hope our members can find and discuss news that is important to them. However, news sources that spam the feed, hew toward inflammatory or shocking headlines, or generally exist purely to drive content consumption will be limited (able to be followed but not publicly visible in the public feeds unless followed) or, in egregious cases, suspended. Certain local news sources have communicated with Tŵt and are welcome in the Local feed. To avoid these providers please use the Block function. To apply to become an approved news source please see https://github.com/tootwales/documentation/blob/main/ApprovedNewsAccounts.md 

## Imagery and Alternative Text
When posting images or photographs, it is customary and respectful to add a description of the image. Many members are blind or suffer from sight issues. Alternative text is shown when images are not loaded; will be read aloud by screen reading software; and can be helpful for understanding the intent of a shared image. This is especially important when the image is a picture of text. Additionally, text can be translated into other languages, an image cannot.

See [https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/) for guidance on using images online. See also [https://supercooldesign.co.uk/blog/how-to-write-good-alt-text](https://supercooldesign.co.uk/blog/how-to-write-good-alt-text) for guidance on writing useful descriptive text.

In general, describe the image as if you were talking on the telephone. Keep it simple, say what you see.

Not including alternative text will not be grounds for removal, but please note that many of your community members will not boost or share images that are not described, limiting your image’s reach on the network. Images and media that are not described will not be boosted, shared, or recommended by staff.

## Moderator Actions
Illegal content will be removed and the member may be reported to law enforcement.

Disallowed content will be removed.

Sensitive content will be marked as sensitive.

For other Code of Conduct reports, in most instances a Moderator will contact the Member and offer a means to correct the content or activity. Members who do not wish to abide by our Code of Conduct may be Silenced during a further Moderator conversation. Silenced members can still be seen by their followers, but will not appear in the public feeds.

Members who repeatedly fail to follow the Code of Conduct may be suspended from the service.

Please note that we cannot moderate all languages. At this time we are allowing European Union language accounts, but cannot accept registrations in any other language. Unsupported language accounts will be suspended with the Unsupported Language Notice and given guidance on finding an appropriate service provider; members will have 30 days to move their account to an alternative service provider. See http://mastodon-near.me/ to find a server in your country or language. If you would like to volunteer to moderate in a particular language, please email hello@toot.wales

## General Principles
Tŵt services are a public service accessible by millions. The mission is to provide a communications medium through which we all as fellow humans can freely associate and interact with one another in a warm, respectful environment, even if we disagree with one another on certain subjects.
