# Tŵt Community Code of Conduct

## Preamble
Tŵt Cymru | Toot Wales (“Tŵt”) is a collection of Web services whose mission is to connect Cymru and its diverse community, at home and abroad, encouraging and enabling the use of the Welsh language online. We strive to provide a welcoming, bilingual platform that is free from hate, discrimination, and abuse.
To that end, the following guidance reflects the wishes of the Tŵt staff and membership. In all cases, when using the Tŵt services we ask you be respectful, be mindful, and be nice.

## Disallowed Content and Activity

 - Spam, and inauthentic activity (see https://github.com/tootwales/documentation/blob/main/SpamAndInauthenticActivity.md )
 - Unused accounts 
 - Uncurated bots (see https://github.com/tootwales/documentation/blob/main/AutomatedAndBotContent.md )
 - Untagged nudity, including artistic depictions
 - Untagged gore or graphic violence, including artistic depictions
 - Discrimination against race, ethnicity, gender, gender identity, sex, sexual orientation, native language, age, ability, marital status, family status, caste, national origin, socioeconomic status, religion, geographic location, or any other dimension of diversity
 - Xenophobia and/or violent nationalism, hate, hateful terms, symbols, imagery, and shorthand
 - Pornographic material, to include any explicit description or display of sexual activity
 - Sex work, sexual services, including solicitation and offers for such service
 - False or misleading information that may cause or lead to harm
 - Content that can increase the risk that its audience will condone or commit violence against members of another group
 - Content illegal in the United Kingdom, the European Union and its member states, or the United States of America
 - Any conduct intended to stalk or harass other users, or to impede other users from using the service, or to degrade the performance of the service, or to harass other users, or to incite other users to perform any of the aforementioned actions is also disallowed.

These provisions notwithstanding, the administrative staff of the service reserves the right to revoke any user's access, at any time, for any reason, except as limited by law.

## Moderator Actions
 - Illegal content will be removed and the member may be reported to law enforcement.
 - Disallowed content will be removed.
 - Sensitive content will be marked as sensitive (see https://github.com/tootwales/documentation/blob/main/ContentGuidance.md )

For other Code of Conduct reports, in most instances a Moderator will contact the Member and offer a means to correct the content or activity. Members who do not wish to abide by our Code of Conduct may be Silenced during further Moderator conversation. Silenced members can still be seen by their followers, but will not appear in the public feeds.

Members who repeatedly fail to follow the Code of Conduct may be suspended from the service.

## Language Policy
Please note that we cannot moderate all languages. At this time we are allowing European Union language accounts as well as accounts that make use of Punjabi, Urdu, Bengali, Gujarati, Tamil and Turkish, but cannot accept registrations in any other language. Unsupported language accounts will be suspended with the Unsupported Language Notice and given guidance on finding an appropriate service provider; members will have 30 days to move their account to an alternative service provider. See http://mastodon-near.me/ to find a server in your country or language. If you would like to volunteer to moderate in a particular language, please email hello@toot.wales

## Community Input
This Code of Conduct is reviewed frequently by the Toot Wales Community Council (https://www.loomio.com/twt/) and reviewed for applicability and actionability by the Moderator team. A list of all parties can be found at https://github.com/tootwales/documentation/blob/main/Organisation.md
