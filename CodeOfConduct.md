# Tŵt Community Code of Conduct

_(Fersiwn Cymraeg ddim ar gael eto. Cysylltwch â staff os hoffech chi helpu i gyfieithu)_


```
"We'll keep a welcome in the hillside, we'll keep a welcome in the vale"
```


Tŵt Cymru | Toot Wales (“Tŵt”) is a collection of Web services whose mission is to connect Wales and the Welsh, at home and abroad, encouraging and enabling the use of the Welsh language online. We strive to provide a welcoming platform that is free from hate, discrimination, and aggression.

Tŵt offers members the opportunity to post text, image, sound and video to the Fediverse, a collection of thousands of servers around the world from which millions of people find and follow people to communicate with. As part of the Fediverse, Tŵt endeavours to provide a moderate, friendly channel for all manner of topics and conversations, while observing the accepted etiquette of being in a public space connected to the federated servers and people around the world.

To that end, the following guidance reflects the wishes of the Tŵt membership, its staff, and the community as a whole. While no such document can be inclusive of all eventualities, it offers a guide to the kinds of content and conduct expected on the service. 

Members who contravene this Code of Conduct may be subject to content deletion, account limiting, or account suspension.

**In all cases, when using the Tŵt services be respectful, be mindful, and be nice.**


## Disallowed Content


### The following types of content are disallowed and will be removed:

* Excessive advertising, or accounts used solely for advertising with no community engagement
* Accounts with no profile picture (“avatar”) and little or no engagement
* Uncurated bots
* Untagged nudity, pornography or sexually explicit content, including artistic depictions
* Untagged gore or extremely graphic violence, including artistic depictions

### The following types of content are disallowed and will be removed, and may result in revocation of access to the service:

* Racism or advocation of racism
* Sexism or advocation of sexism
* Discrimination against family status, gender, gender identity or expression, marital status, sex, sexual orientation, native language, age, ability, race and/or ethnicity, caste, national origin, socioeconomic status, religion, geographic location, or any other dimension of diversity
* Xenophobia and/or violent nationalism
* Hateful terms, symbols, imagery, and shorthand
* False or misleading information that may cause or lead to harm

### The following types of content are disallowed and will be removed, and will result in revocation of access to the service:

* Sexual depictions of children, fictional or real
* Content illegal in the United Kingdom, the European Union and its member states, or the United States of America
* Content or conduct promoting the ideology of National Socialism
* Content that can increase the risk that its audience will condone or commit violence against members of another group
* Any conduct intended to stalk or harass other users, or to impede other users from using the service, or to degrade the performance of the service, or to harass other users, or to incite other users to perform any of the aforementioned actions is also disallowed. This includes, but is not limited to:
    * Continuing to engage in conversation with a user that has specifically requested for said engagement to cease and desist is considered harassment, regardless of privacy tools employed.
    * Aggregating, posting, and/or disseminating a person's demographic, personal, or private data without express permission (informally called "doxing" or "dropping dox").
    * Inciting users to engage another user in continued interaction or discussion after a user has requested for said engagement to cease and desist (informally known as "brigading" or "dogpiling").

These provisions notwithstanding, the administrative staff of the service reserves the right to revoke any user's access, at any time, for any reason, except as limited by law.


## Spam

You may not use Tŵt services in a manner intended to artificially amplify or suppress information or engage in behavior that manipulates or disrupts another member’s experience. This includes commercial spam, and spam that typically aims to drive traffic or attention from a conversation on Tŵt to specific or third-party accounts, Web sites, products, services, or initiatives. Inauthentic engagement that attempts to make accounts or content appear more popular or active than they are; coordinated activity through the use of multiple accounts, fake accounts, automation and/or scripting may all result in Limited or Suspended access.

Flooding a timeline - repeatedly posting in rapid succession with little to no engagement - is not allowed.

Registration of trademarks or famous names is subject to review, and may be subject to verification.

Multiple account registrations can lead to a large number of inactive accounts. To be certain that your account isn't removed due to inactivity, be sure to upload an avatar and post at least once. Accounts without avatars or any activity may be deleted to free up space on the service.


## Sensitive Content

We believe that participation in social media should be a rewarding activity, one that brings joy and connection. As such, while there are topics and content that are worthy of discussion, we hope our members are mindful of those who do not want their social media feed to be divisive, inflammatory, or upsetting.

The service provides a headline feature that can be used to title a post. This functionality is known as a “Content Notice” or “Content Warning” or “Content Wrapper” or “CW”. This places the bulk of a post behind a headline, and requires an affirmative click from members to view its contents. It is similar to describing a section of a Web site or a topic of a discussion board, but each member can create whichever topics they choose. It is not a signal that the content is undesirable, merely that there is a good chance a reasonable portion of the membership does not want to see the full content.

If your post meets one of the following criteria, we ask you to show love and respect for your community and use a CW to describe what the member will see if they choose to open it. 

In all cases: is your post divisive and inflammatory? Is it intended to shock people out of their comfort zone? Is the feed currently overwhelmed with this topic? These are all good reasons to add a topic headline using the CW feature.

Notwithstanding, aggressive rage has no home on our service. While anger and frustration are justifiable for many, this is not the forum for expressing rage and aggression. Content that is marked as Disallowed in this policy will be removed regardless of the use of CW functionality.

| Topic | Common CW Headlines |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Politics | ukpol, walpol, tory, uspol, trump |
| Sex and Sexual Content | sex, sexual content, nudity |
| Mental Health and Health Issues | mh, ph, alcohol, drugs, addiction, suicide |
| Common Phobias | spiders, heights, snakes, blood |
| Disturbing Content | gore, death, violence, abuse, war |
| Offensive Language | swears, nsfw |
| Direct Eye Contact | ec, eye contact |
| Live Sports, Spoilers, and Event Outcomes | WALvIRE, cricket spoiler, strictly, bake off |

### Politics

Politics and politicking are a divisive issue for many. Politicking (i.e. activities performed to acquire or retain the power of politics), seeking someone’s vote or agreement, content intended to sway political opinion, content about politicians, elections and electioneering, or party political messaging should include a CW.


### Nudity, Sex and Sexual Content

Tŵt is for use by adults only. Nonetheless, nudity and explicit content specifically focussed on the act of sex or sexual content requires a CW.

Sex workers seeking to offer services cannot be accommodated (see [https://switter.at/](https://switter.at/) for the history of this policy), please consider https://tryst.link/


### Mental Health and Health Issues

Many people around the world suffer from all manner of health and mental health issues. Show empathy to others by placing your individual health and mental health content behind a CW.


### Common Phobias

Just because you are not afraid of spiders does not mean no-one else is. Anything that is known to be a common phobia requires a CW, especially if imagery is included.


### Disturbing Content

If there is a valid reason to share content that could reasonably be expected to disturb some, use a CW .


### Offensive Language

There are plenty of good reasons and thoughtful or entertaining ways to use offensive or profane language. When using obscene profanity a CW is appropriate. Not everyone shares the same perception of what words are offensive. Any discriminatory, harrassing, disrespectful, or insulting language will be removed regardless of it’s perceived offensiveness or use of CW.


### Direct Eye Contact

This can be a disconcertingly personal invasion of a very impersonal, asymmetrical activity. Additionally, roughly one percent of the population, and therefore one percent of our membership, has Autism Spectrum Disorder, and can find direct eye contact extremely uncomfortable. Please place eye contact imagery behind a CW.


### Live Sports and Events

Not everyone can watch the match or show at the same time as you, and even fewer people care about the match or show you are watching. Also, some people may be a few minutes behind but can now see the immediate future thanks to your timely posts. Putting a CW allows the thread or post to live in the public timeline without spoiling the outcome for others, and without forcing everyone to follow a conversation they have no interest in.


### General CW / Headline Guidance

In general, ask yourself if what you are posting is intended to shock, inflame, offend. Is there a good reason to suspect some might not want to see this? Am I enraged right now? Am I being respectful?

Think of the CW as a way to describe the topic. Newspapers have sections. Think of your headline as describing the section for the site that this post belongs in. In no way is CW intended to discourage posting of a particular topic, it is merely a helpful way for the millions of viewers to decide what content they wish to engage with.

Not including CW text will not necessarily be grounds for suspension, but please note that many of your community members will not boost or reblog sensitive content that is not described, limiting your post’s reach on the network.

_(NB: Mastodon does not track hashtags within the CW Headline. Place hashtags in the content of the post.)_

Hate and hateful language is not tolerated in any form. Derogatory language, insulting language, discriminatory bias or bigotry is not tolerated in any form. As a tolerant community, the only thing we do not tolerate is intolerance.


## Automated and Bot Content

Bots can provide helpful updates and content. However, many members wish to interact with other members, not bots. Bot accounts must be marked as such in their account settings. This allows members to understand the account is not monitored for replies, and the bot content will not be listed in the Trending section.

The following bot activity will be suspended from the service:



* Wholesale redistributing or mirroring content from external services
* Mirroring or copying content from people who have not given consent
* Unsolicited direct messages or mentioned posts
* Automatedly posting about trending hashtags or topics
* Posting the same content across multiple accounts


## Journalism

Tŵt is not intended to be a source of global news. Instead, it can serve as a place to discuss the news. We exist for community, not content consumption. 

Journalism is a vital profession and activity, and we hope our members can find and discuss news that is important to them. However, news sources that spam the feed, hew toward inflammatory or shocking headlines, or generally exist purely to drive content consumption will be limited (able to be followed but not publicly visible in the public feeds unless followed) or, in egregious cases, suspended. Certain local news sources have communicated with Tŵt and are welcome in the Local feed. To avoid these providers please use the Block function.


## Imagery and Alternative Text

When posting images or photographs, it is customary and respectful to add a description of the image. Many members are blind or suffer from sight issues. Alternative text will be shown when images are not loaded; will be read aloud by screen reading software; and can be helpful for understanding the intent of a shared image. This is especially important when the image is a picture of text. Additionally, text can be translated into other languages, an image cannot.

See [https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/) for guidance on using images online. See also [https://supercooldesign.co.uk/blog/how-to-write-good-alt-text](https://supercooldesign.co.uk/blog/how-to-write-good-alt-text) for guidance on writing useful descriptive text.

In general, describe the image as if you were talking on the telephone. Keep it simple, say what you see.

Not including alternative text will not be grounds for removal, but please note that many of your community members will not boost or reblog images that are not described, limiting your image’s reach on the network.


## Moderator Actions

Illegal content will be removed and the member may be reported to law enforcement.

Disallowed content will be removed.

Sensitive content will be marked as Sensitive.

For other Code of Conduct reports, in most instances, a Moderator will contact the Member and offer a means to correct the content or activity. Members who do not wish to abide by our Code of Conduct may be Silenced during a further Moderator conversation. Silenced members can still be seen by their followers, but will not appear in the public feeds.

Members who repeatedly fail to follow the Code of Conduct will be Suspended from the service.

Please note that we cannot moderate all languages. At this time we are allowing European Union languages, but cannot accept registrations in any other language. Unsupported language accounts will be suspended with the Unsupported Language Note and guidance on finding an appropriate service provider; members will have 30 days to move their account to an alternative service provider.


## General Principles

_“How about such and such a word?”. “Can I say this or that?” “No-one said I can’t do this or the other!” “You’re censoring me!” “Divers alarums!”_

Tŵt services are a public service accessible by millions. The mission is to provide a communications medium through which we all as fellow humans can associate and interact with one another in a warm, respectful environment, even if we disagree with one another on certain subjects.

There are plenty of channels on the Internet for content and conversation that do not fit our criteria. If you find our Code of Conduct too onerous, please go elsewhere. The above is not a judgement on any particular individuals’ views or activities, it is merely the confines within which we, as a social network provider, choose to operate.
