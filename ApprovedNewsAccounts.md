# Publishing News
We welcome Wales-based national and local news and weather that are relevant to our member audience, in either Welsh or English language format. Many sources publish automatedly using a bot or autoposter of some kind.

## General Guidance
- Accounts with a limited frequency are free to post in the Public timeline. Large volume accounts must use the unlisted feature. Unlisted simply means your posts do not appear in the main timeline, but can still be found and followed. A public post occasionally reminding our members that your news source is available to be followed is appropriate.
- When posting images to support your news stories, alternative text describing the image is required.
- If posting images of text instead of text, your account will be suspended.
- If your Web site is Wordpress-based, there are numerous plugins to help you post to toot.wales, see https://wordpress.org/plugins/tags/mastodon/
- Accounts that use automated posting features must mark the account as a bot. This helps people to know they cannot interact with the post by replying, that the account is unmonitored. Monitored accounts do not need to be marked as bot.

### Twitter
Automatic mirroring from Twitter is forbidden unless:
1. the post contains the text "RT"
2. any Twitter usernames e.g. @name@twitter.com are suppressed
3. images contain alternative text

### Meta / Facebook
Automatic mirroring from Facebook or Instagram is forbidden.
